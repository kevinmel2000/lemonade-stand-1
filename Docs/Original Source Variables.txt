A(i): Assets (cash on hand, in dollars) 
C: cost of lemonade per glass, in cents 
G(i): normally 1; 0 if everything is ruined by thunderstorm 
H(i): apparently intended to relate to storms, but never assigned a value 
I: current player number, 1 to N 
L(i): number of glasses of lemonade made by player i 
N: number of players 
P(i): Price charged for lemonade, per glass, in cents 
R1: weather factor; 1 for good weather, 0>R<1 for poor weather;   
  also adjusts traffic for things like street crews working 
R2: set to 2 half the time when street department is working;   
  indicates that street crew bought all lemonade at lunch 
R3: always equal to 0; not used 
S(i): Number of signs made by player i 
S3: cost per advertising sign, in dollars 
SC: sky color (2=sunny, 5=thunderstorms, 7=hot & dry, 10=cloudy). 
X1: set to 1 when it's cloudy; not sure what the intent was, but has   
  no actual effect since line 2100 is unreachable. 
X2: set to 1 when the street crew has worked and was not thirsty;   
  apparently intended to prevent street crews from coming again,   
  but doesn't actually work since line 2200 is unreachable.


J = rain chance

P9: High price offset, const 10
S2: Sales modifier? const 30
A2: Assets start value, const 2
C9: Negative sign modifier? const  .5 (negSignMod)
C2: Extra sign modifier? const 1 (extraSignMod)

W: Sign modifier (signMod)
V: Sign modification result? (signModResult)

N1: Initial glasses sold (salesFactor)
N2: Glasses sold? (soldGlasses)

M: Revenue
E: Expenses
P1: Profits

pseudo calc code:

if (street crew bought all)
   sell all
if (assets less than 0)
   assets = 0

if (price less than high offset)
   salesFactor = (high offset - price) / high offset * .8 * sales mod + sales mod
else
   salesFactor = (high offset ^ 2) * sales mod / price ^ 2
signMod = - signs * negSignMod
signModResult = 1 - (exp(signMod) * extraSignMod) // extra sign mod

soldGlasses = rainFactor * (salesFactor + (salesFactor * signModResult))
soldGlasses = soldGlasses * (zeroIfStorm)

revenue = min(madeGlasses, soldGlasses) * price
expenses = madeSigns * signPrice + madeGlasses * priceOfGlass
profit = revenue - expenses
